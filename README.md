# About

These are my personal configuration files.
They tend to be MacOS specific as opposed to linux based these days.

# Using

Ideally, running the `mac_installs.sh` file should do a good portion of the setup of current.
I've never actually run it because I change my setup so frequently and experiment so often that it is often behind in my current standards and preferences.
Pair that with how infrequently I change computers and you have the recipe ripe for unmaintained software.
That said, it is a nice guide post for things that are still relevant when it does occur.
